# ezcv
*A template repo for bootstrapping ezcv projects*

This demo assumes you are:
1. Using GitHub
2. Using GitHub pages for deployment
3. Know [Markdown Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

## Setup
1. Click on "Use this template" on the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/QU-UP/ezcv)
2. On the new repository page MAKE SURE YOU CHECK OFF "Include all branches"

## Usage

There are two options for creating your site; local and remote editing.

Regardless of which you choose, go through and pick out an [included theme](https://ezcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/included-themes/), and use that to guide which section and configuration variables you need

### Remote editing

Follow the steps outlined on [this guide](https://ezcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start/#remote-editing)

### Local Editing

To edit locally you should know how to use [git](https://git-scm.com/).

1. Install a markdown editor (you can technically use any text editor but I would recommend a real editor) such as [typora](https://typora.io/)
2. Clone your git repo
3. Add in your content
4. On push to main/master the site will be deployed to github pages for you
